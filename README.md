# osr-usb-fx2-linux-driver
A Linux driver for the OSR USB FX2 Windows driver development board, forked from https://github.com/nmikstas/osr-usb-fx2-linux-driver.

Includes some adjustments to make it runnable with newer kernel versions, tested with 4.19 and 5.11.

The branch hw-prog is for adjustments and comments made for a task as part of my hardware programming module.
